Continue the execution of your program to the end, and skip one or more next breakpoints along the way. This command is useful when you put the [34mjard[0m command in an iteration or a nested method call.

[34;1mNote:[0m
Ruby Jard resets the skip list in the next attachment or when your program exits. If you are running a web server or a background job that prevents your program from stopping (and you have already skipped all breakpoints), your program may not stop and may require a restart to attach again.

[34;1mExamples:[0m

[34mskip      # Continue and skip the first breakpoint[0m
[34mskip 2    # Continue and skip the first 2 breakpoints[0m
[34mskip -a    # Continue and skip all breakpoints[0m
[34mskip --all # Continue and skip all breakpoints[0m
