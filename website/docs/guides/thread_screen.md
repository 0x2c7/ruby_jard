<LinkedImage link="/img/guides/threads-screen.png" alt="Threads screen"/>

Show all the threads running at the moment. This screen is useful when you are working with a complicated multi-threaded environment like web server, or background jobs.

Thread ID displayed in the screen is sequential uniqued virtual thread IDs generated by Jard. In future, you can use this ID to debug a multi-threaded program.

Threads are sorted by status, thread name, then by location.

Ruby Jard won't display suspended, killed, finished, or Jard-internal threads.
