<LinkedImage link="/img/guides/threads-screen.png" alt="Threads screen"/>

Show all currently running threads. This screen is useful when working in a complicated multi-threaded environment like a web server or background job system.

The thread ID displayed on the screen is a unique, virtual, and sequential thread ID generated by Jard. In the future, you will be able to use this ID to debug multi-threaded programs.

Threads are sorted first by status, then by thread name, and finally by location.

Ruby Jard won't display suspended, killed, finished, or Jard-internal threads.
