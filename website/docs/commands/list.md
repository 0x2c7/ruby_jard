import {LinkedImage} from '../../src/components/LinkedImage'

| Command | Default key binding | Alias |
| ------- | ------------------- | ----- |
| `list` | F5 | `l`, `whereami` |

Refresh the whole terminal UI. This command doesn't move you to other steps, nor change any data in your session. It is useful (or the only way) to get back the beautiful UI if you type too much in the REPL console.
